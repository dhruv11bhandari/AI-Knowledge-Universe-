# AI Knowledge Universe

An interactive web app for exploring the AI company ecosystem using semantic
search, sentence embeddings, and knowledge graphs. Built as a learning
project to practice combining a Flask backend with modern NLP tooling
(Sentence Transformers + FAISS) and graph visualization (NetworkX + PyVis).

## Project Overview

AI Knowledge Universe lets you:

- Search for AI companies using natural language (e.g. *"companies building
  robotics models"*) instead of exact keyword matches
- Browse a dashboard with stats and category breakdowns
- View a company's profile, including related and semantically similar
  companies
- Explore an interactive knowledge graph showing how companies connect
  through shared categories, founders, technologies, and description
  similarity

The dataset ships with 20 curated AI companies (`sample_data/`) so the whole
pipeline runs out of the box without needing to scrape the web.

## Features

- **Data pipeline** — cleans and normalizes company data (dedupe, tag
  generation, category normalization)
- **Semantic search** — Sentence Transformer embeddings + a FAISS index for
  fast nearest-neighbor search
- **Knowledge graph** — a NetworkX graph connecting companies by shared
  category, founder, technology, or embedding similarity, rendered as an
  interactive PyVis graph
- **Company pages** — overview, technologies, related companies (graph
  neighbors), and similar companies (embedding neighbors)
- **Dashboard** — total companies, category counts, recent additions, and a
  search box

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo and create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd project
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the data pipeline** (only needs to be done once, or whenever the
   sample dataset changes)

   ```bash
   python scraper/scraper.py      # copies sample data into data/raw/
   python scraper/cleaner.py      # cleans it into data/cleaned/
   python embedding/embed.py      # generates embeddings
   python embedding/faiss_index.py  # builds the FAISS index
   python graph/visualize.py      # pre-builds the graph HTML (optional, app can do this on demand)
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

> Note: the first time you run `embed.py`, Sentence Transformers will
> download the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (a few hundred MB). This requires
> an internet connection but only happens once — it's cached locally after
> that.

## Future Improvements

- Replace the sample dataset with a real scraper for specific AI company
  directories
- Add a proper database (SQLite or Postgres) instead of JSON files
- Add pagination and filters to the search results page
- Cache the knowledge graph instead of rebuilding it on every request to
  `/graph`
- Add unit tests for the cleaning and graph-building logic
- Deploy the app (e.g. Render, Railway, or Heroku) with a persistent
  embeddings index
